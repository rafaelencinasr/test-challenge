# Challenge: Jest

## Basic info

### What is this
- It's just a small excercise
- Focused for unit tests with Jest
- It can be refactored
- It can be optimized

### Tech

- Jest
- Jest dependencies
- That's it

### Components
  - ```calculator.js``` and ```users.js``` has all main methods to test
  - Inside  ```tests``` directory is where you should write you test cases
  - ```data.js``` contains an array of user data. This is your data to manipulate.
  - You can ignore ```index.js```

### Other Components

- Write the named files for each case.
    
    1. Write a function that takes in a number and returns one of the following:
        - If the number is divisible by 3, return 'Fizz'.
        - If the number is divisible by 5, return 'Buzz'.
        - If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return 'FizzBuzz'
        - Else, return the number passed as an argument

    2. Write a function that takes in a DNA string (for example 'CTAGGGTA') and returns a new string with any non-canonical DNA base values removed. Canonical base values are single characters: 'C', 'T', 'A', and 'G' only. Make the function case sensitive - meaning 'c' (lower case) should be removed from the string, but 'C' (upper case) is a good value and should remain. If the DNA string is empty, just return an empty string.


    3. Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
